We will list functionalities of our basic kernel below:
* Basic IO
* Print usable memory
* Exception printer
* Virtual to physical address
* Page Mapping
* Basic system call
* Loading and running executable (elf)
* stdlib
* Change to usermode

## Acknowledgements
The starter code is provided by professor Charlie Curtsinger, references for starter code is listed below.

The starter code is based on the following example projects:
- [OSDev.org Bare Bones Kernel](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_bones)
- [Stivale2 Barebones Kernel](https://github.com/stivale/stivale2-barebones)

In addition to the above example projects, the following references were used when setting up starter code:
